In the afternoon, you can do more sightseeing with our guide in Kathmandu, or if you desire to take some time for yourself that’s even so possible. This afternoon, it’s also a good opportunity to stock up with anything you may have forgotten before heading up to a rural placement. The tourist hub of Thamel will be able to furnish you with anything from Marmite to an extra pair of Merino socks.

                                <strong>Day 4: Introduction Host Family and Start Project
                                </strong>
                                <br>
                                After about two days of language classes and sightseeing, you will be moved to the host family. They will be fully trained about hosting volunteers and you won’t be left in the dark about anything: toilets, drinking water, bedding, how to work the shower, where to buy anything you need nearby, basic etiquette. If you want an early night then that is fine, but you will also be given the opportunity to ring home or send emails from the Nepal Volunteers office so any parents or loved ones won’t be worrying about you. It’s possible we already start this day at your project. If time appears to be short, we will start the next day in the morning. Our  director will discuss and finalise your program at arrival so you know what to expect the first days in Nepal.

                                While you volunteer with Nepal Volunteers, you will be staying with a Nepali host family. By living with a family you will gain a greater insight and understanding of Nepali culture. You will be part of a Nepali family, eat together with the family and play with the children. Many volunteers tell us this unique insight into the culture of Nepal is a key part of why they come back again and again.

                                <br>
                                The standard of lodging will depend on whether you are in a rural or urban area. In a rural area the facilities will be basic with minimal running water and a squat toilet. In an urban placement you will have a flushing Western style toilet and a shower. All of your food will be provided for you at your home stay and you will never be more than 30 minutes from your place of work. For more information on what to expect in a home stay have a look at our food and accommodation page.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All our host families have conducted training regarding hosting volunteers adequately. They know how to ensure hygiene and provide security. They will treat you as a member of the family.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you arrive on placement you will be introduced to your host family by the Nepal Volunteers representative and given a full tour of the premises. Many of our host families have children and many of our volunteers enjoy helping them with their English, learning to cook Nepali food and mixing in with their life. The other way around, we experience volunteers learning a lot from the hosts and children regarding life in Nepal.
                                At the host families you will stay with fellow volunteers. It is always possible to stay as a couple or group of friends in one host family. You should consider the host family as your temporary family in Nepal. They can help you regarding how to discover the neighbourhood, advice on travels and offer you warmth in times of homesickness.
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                You should not expect luxury on your stay in Nepal. Nepal is a developing country and may well be different from what you are used to at home. However, you will have your own room unless requested otherwise, and the rooms are always clean and comfortable. The quality of toilet and washing facilities vary significantly between placements. If you are based in Kathmandu you may find you have a hot shower and a Western style toilet in your homestay. However, if you are in a rural placement then it is more likely that you will have a traditional squat toilet and a cold shower. If you feel like having a hot shower and flushing the toilet is a priority then make this clear when you are applying and we will see if it is possible to find you one of our better equipped host families.

                                The electricity supply in all areas is good, but sometimes there is a power cut which can last up to 5 hours. In the cities some houses have backup batteries that will run low power bulbs in key rooms, but in the rural areas you can expect to use candles. A head-torch is a very useful thing to bring.

                                On placement you will usually eat with the family and share the same food as them. At least two meals a day are provided for you while volunteering. The usual meal times are between 9 and 10 AM and 6 and 8 PM. You will usually be served the national staple of Dal Bhat Tarkari which is a tasty and filling plate of rice, vegetable curry, lentils and pickles. It may occasionally have meat such as chicken or mutton in it, although if you are vegetarian this can easily be explained. This may be supplemented occasionally by noodles, eggs and other snacks dependent on your host family and placement

The cities of Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur and Chobhar are located in this valley, and each displays excellent examples of Newar art and architecture. The valley is the cultural and political hub of Nepal, but this melting pot of traditions and different Nepali

                            <strong>Why pay for volunteering?</strong>
                            <br>
                            You probably asked yourself on occasion. Why pay for volunteering? After all…you’re offering your services free of charge… and on top of that you have to pay? How ridiculous is that?? The question one should ask though is: “what is it I’m paying for?” In the following points, we will shed light on this question, and hopefully will have answered any misconceptions many people have on volunteering. As a potential intern/volunteer you need to understand that below is a list of reasons why a program fee is required.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>1. Airport Pickup & Transfer</strong>
                            <br>
                            After travelling halfway around the world to a country you’ve never visited, there should be someone who will greet you at the airport who then grabs your bag and whisks you away in a car. When it comes time to leave, you have someone willing to help you lug your bags back to the airport and see you off.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>2. Logistics</strong>
                            <br>
                            The most difficult part of picking up your life and plopping down in another country is all the logistics involved. From finding a place to live to obtaining the perfect volunteer placement, the details are much easier to accomplish when you have a local there to guide you or take care of it for you — who, obviously, needs an income. Additionally, we have our own project developed to place our volunteers and have also developed relationships with many schools, hospitals, and orphanages in every part of Nepal where we can get you to the placement there.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>3. Language and Orientation</strong>
                            <br>
                            As a volunteer, you can be very useful. However it takes time to understand not only your role but how your placement organisation works as well as local cultural practices and etiquette, which is why orientation and training are a crucial part of any responsible volunteer program. The orientation will include language training or cultural orientation by our staff. The fees paid by you will help us to develop our training programs and hire quality individuals to run them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>4. Food & Accommodation</strong>
                            <br>
                            We charge a fee  not only to set up your accommodation but also include the cost of living in your program fee. The program we arrange at a homestay, you will have your meals cooked for you by the host family, in which case you would be charged in advance.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>5. In-Country Assistance</strong>
                            <br>
                            Perhaps the volunteer placement isn’t all you hoped it would be. Or you need help sorting out a banking issue, renewing a visa, or tracking down a doctor who speaks English. Having associated with an organisation in-country to help with issues that inevitably arise can be invaluable, especially if you aren’t fluent in the local language. We know which doctors to visit when you’re sick, where the best place to buy a bus ticket is, how to avoid being scammed, and so much more! Plus we are around to help at all hours of the day, so if an emergency happens on a weekend or in the night, we are always available for you to call. We also keep in touch with family members if the unlikely happens and you need to be evacuated from the country or fall seriously ill. For those with worrying parents the peace of mind might be worth the money!.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>6. Programmatic Support & Continuity</strong>
                            <br>
                            We charge a fee  not only to set up your accommodation but also include the cost of living in your program fee. The program we arrange at a homestay, you will have your meals cooked for you by the host family, in which case you would be charged in advance.

                            <br>
                            <strong>7. Trips and Excursions</strong>
                            <br>
                            We offer you to choose trips for you a wide range of volunteering, trekking, tour, rafting, peak climbing, jungle safari, home stays program including tours to Tibet and India to experience the unique beauty of the Himalayas region, to enjoy the customs and food of the diverse people who call Nepal home; to be awed by the mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, jungle and ancient cities and to have the journey of a lifetime, this is a great way to see the country without being responsible for the logistics. Plus it means you will have the opportunity to better acquaint yourself with your fellow volunteers and local staff. Note: In some cases, you may work directly for the organisation in need of volunteers and there may be volunteering programs with little fee. These organisations may be local or international, and their process for applying generally differs from our organisation as it will be more tailored to their requirements and needs and less so on those of the volunteers. But, be aware that they usually are unable or unwilling to provide above mentioned logistics and support like arranging housing, orientation, sight -seeing, language classes, visa Assistance, 24/7 support and social and Cultural activities etc.
